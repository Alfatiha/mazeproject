The Maze Game

This project is created by Alfatiha Ahmed for portfolio project using the librabry SDL2
to play this game:
INSTALL git clone git@github.com:Alfatiha/mazeproject.git
in the repo that you cloned this repository run /maze
to clean type rm maze
COMPILE make sure you compile (make) with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags` `sdl2-config --libs`

The maze project proved to be quite challenging, and it required me to use a programming language called C, along with the SDL library for game development. As a software engineering student, this was a completely new concept for me, and I had to start from scratch. I began by revisiting my knowledge of C programming and familiarizing myself with the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).


Although we had learned C at the beginning of the program in Alx, it had been a while since we last used it. While working on this project, I struggled to maintain focus as I constantly had to refer back to the project resources to ensure the code was clear and error-free. Despite the difficulties, I made progress each day, which filled me with a sense of pride and motivated me to keep going.


Today, I am proud to present my completed maze game. Along the way, I encountered several challenges. One of the main obstacles was understanding the shortcuts and features of the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor, as it was my first time using it. Initially, it was quite daunting, but with time and practice, I became more comfortable with it.


In conclusion, despite the initial setback of not being able to pursue my preferred project idea, I am pleased with the outcome of my maze project. It pushed me to learn new concepts and technologies, and I overcome various challenges along the way. This experience has taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of obstacles.
